# AnalysisofTwitterSentiment

For this class project, my team and I wanted to understand how college students' emotions shift during the academic quarter—especially during midterms and finals. We looked at over 1.6 million tweets from the Sentiment140 dataset and used sentiment analysis to see how stress, anxiety, and other feelings showed up on Twitter from April through June.

What I worked on:

Cleaned and organized the data to get it ready for analysis

Filtered tweets to find ones that were relevant to college life and exams

Ran sentiment analysis and hypothesis testing to look for emotional trends over time

Created univariate, bivariate, and other graphs to draw conclusions using pandas, seaborn, etc.

Helped interpret the results and visualize what we found

Our biggest takeaway? Negative sentiment definitely spikes during finals week. So yeah—students really are tweeting through it. The project gave me a solid hands-on experience with data wrangling, NLP, and emotional trend analysis, and made me think more about how social media reflects what students are really feeling.
